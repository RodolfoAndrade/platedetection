# platedetection
Here is found the project presented in the elective course Co-Design Hardware-Software 2016.2, UFPE, Cin.

The algorithm implemented is capable of detecting the car plate from the frontal or back image of a car. The implementation used C++ and SystemC language, together with OpenCV library.

In the PDF report (Naikur_Gohil_Project_Report.pdf) is possible to find more information on the steps of the algorithms.
